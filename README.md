py to prompt for SSID

This commit updates the obfuscated Wi-Fi bruteforce script to prompt the user for the SSID at runtime, instead of taking it as a command-line argument. This aligns the script with the user's final request.

The readable version of the script has been removed to keep the commit focused on the requested changes
